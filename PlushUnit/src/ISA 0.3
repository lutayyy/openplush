ISA 0.3

An Instruction

mov r1 [00000001]

mov -> 003 - Opcode
r1 -> 11 - Memory register; 00001000 - Register address
[00000001] -> 00 - Remory register; 00000001 - Ram address


Memory register
11 - An address is a register address
00 - An address is a ram address
10 - It is not an address, it is a number


Instruction bits:
0 1 2 - Opcode
3 4 - Memory register
5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 - Address
(5 6 7 8 9 - Register address)
13 14 - Memory register
15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 - Address
(15 16 17 18 19 - Register addres)

Finally: 23 bits


Registers mapping:

r0 - Temporary data

Do not write any info to ram[0] it will be freed!

r1 - r32 - Free


Ram mapping:

0 <-> 32 - Temporary data (Addres 0)

Do not write any info to ram[0] it will be freed!

32 <-> 4096 - Free
